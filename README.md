# Walvak
This project is my first project made with the SFML library.
It contains all my skills. I started to learn and practice the C++ 6 months ago. I have been helped to make this project.
My inspiration was the game named *WAVEN* which is a turn per turn game.

## The gameplay
You have some spells which have many effects like inflicting damages or healing you.
You can use them but they coast some mana.
When you are out of mana, your foe hits you and the turn ends.
When you defeat 20 enemies, a boss will appear. The battle will be more dificult.

## Future improvements
I want to create an upgrade system, consisting of a choice of improvements that will make you stronger.
I want also to add bonus levels which will replace battle, in order to buy new spells, to increase the stats of your spells.
Finally, turn the project into a roguelike game.
